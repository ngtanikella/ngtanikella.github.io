_June 2022 --- present_

### [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/){:target="_blank"} - Graduate Research Assistant
**Moscow, Idaho, USA**

I conduct research on additive manufacturing with bio-based composites. My work involves analyzing mechanical and rheological properties of wood-sodium silicate composites, engineering hemp-fiber-reinforced wood composites for construction, and designing novel extruder systems for processing continuous hemp rope. I also manage capstone projects for undergraduate students, providing hands-on training in Design for Manufacturing (DfM), prototyping, and technical communication.

_June 2022 --- present_

### [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/){:target="_blank"} - Graduate Research Assistant
**Moscow, Idaho, USA**

- Analyzed mechanical and rheological properties of 80+ wood-sodium silicate composite samples for additive manufacturing; demonstrated that wood pellets (65% denser than sawdust) reduced storage costs by 40%
- Engineered a hemp-fiber-reinforced wood composite for use in construction, boosting flexural strength by 42%
- Designed and manufactured (SolidWorks, CNC Mill and Lathe) a novel extruder system to process continuous hemp rope, resulting in a 53% increase in tensile strength of 3D-printed parts
- Collaborated with Forestry and Chemistry departments to identify a sustainable bio-resin for additive manufacturing, conducting material characterization (pycnometer, rheometer, X-ray Tomography, FTIR)
- Managed 9 capstone projects (40+ students over three years) from concept to completion, overseeing budgets, procuring components, and providing hands-on training in DfM, prototyping, and technical communication

_May 2024 --- August 2024_

### [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/){:target="_blank"} - Graduate Research Intern
**Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA**

- Resolved critical ink stability issues for Direct Ink Writing (DIW) and Digital Light Processing (DLP) printing by systematically analyzing the Zeta potential of Zeolite and alumina solutions across a range of pH levels, resulting in consistent, defect-free printing
- Implemented a new inventory system for research materials (Darvan821, PVP, PVA), achieving 100% material availability to eliminate research delays and ensuring full MSDS compliance in partnership with the safety team

_April 2016 --- May 2022_

### [Michigan Technological University](https://www.mtu.edu/){:target="_blank"} - Graduate Research Assistant
**Houghton, Michigan, USA**

- Led a 4-person rapid-response team to deliver 100+ face shields during the COVID-19 crisis, managing all project logistics from 24/7 shift scheduling and safety compliance to final product quality assurance
- Spearheaded the mechanical design and system integration for a novel open-source ventilator, translating complex requirements from a multi-disciplinary team (Biology, Electronics) into a functional prototype published in the peer-reviewed journal HardwareX
- Authored a comprehensive database for 20+ Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) materials for Aleph Objects by developing a Design of Experiments (DOE) and a two-step quality control protocol that enhanced functional output
- Designed and implemented a novel cooling system for the Gigabot-X 3D printer, resulting in a 30% reduction in print failures and enhanced quality of 3D-printed components using recycled PET (Re3D project)
- Developed a novel composite via injection molding from waste Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA) and hazardous stamp sand (40% mass) that achieved tensile strength comparable to virgin ABS, offering a remediation strategy for 500M tons of toxic waste

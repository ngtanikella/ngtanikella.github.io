I completed my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at <img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/experience/uidaho.png" alt="University of Idaho" class="inline-logo">[University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/){:target="_blank"}, specializing in additive manufacturing, polymer composites, and Design for Manufacturing (DfM). My research focused on bio-based composite materials for large-scale 3D printing, including wood-sodium silicate composites and hemp-fiber-reinforced materials for construction applications.

During my Ph.D., I worked as a Graduate Research Intern at <img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/experience/ornl.png" alt="Oak Ridge National Laboratory" class="inline-logo">[Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/){:target="_blank"}, where I resolved critical ink stability issues for Direct Ink Writing (DIW) and Digital Light Processing (DLP) printing.
[I also mentored senior year students with their capstone projects.](https://ngtanikella.github.io/mentoring). 

I hold an M.E. in Material Science and an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, both from <img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/experience/mtu.png" alt="Michigan Technological University" class="inline-logo">[Michigan Technological University](https://www.mtu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I worked on open-source 3D printing, material characterization for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), and developed novel composites from recycled and waste materials. [I also led rapid-response manufacturing efforts during the COVID-19 crisis and spearheaded the design of an open-source ventilator published in HardwareX.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ohx.2020.e00131)

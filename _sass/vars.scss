/* =========================
   SITE-WIDE VARIABLES
   =========================

   WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
   Defines reusable values (variables) that are shared across all .scss files.
   Instead of typing "15px" in 20 places, you type "$body-font-size" — then
   to change the font size everywhere, you only edit this ONE line.

   HOW SCSS VARIABLES WORK:
   $variable-name: value;
   The $ prefix marks it as a variable. You can use it anywhere after this
   file is imported. Change the value here → every file that uses it updates.

   THIS FILE IS IMPORTED FIRST by _style.scss (line 1: @import "vars"),
   so every partial (.scss file) has access to these variables.

/* ── Typography ── */

/* Base font size for all body text.
   Increase → all text gets bigger; decrease → all text gets smaller.
   Most other sizes are calculated relative to this. */
$body-font-size: 15px;

/* Publication card title size. Currently 15 + 5 = 20px.
   The "+" is SCSS math — change the 5 to make titles bigger/smaller
   relative to body text. */
$publication-title-font-size: $body-font-size + 5;

/* Footer text size. Currently 15 - 1 = 14px.
   Slightly smaller than body text so the footer feels secondary. */
$footer-font-size: $body-font-size - 1;

/* ── Layout breakpoints & widths ── */

/* $max-width: used inside typography.scss as a responsive breakpoint.
   Below this width, profile pictures and experience logos get bigger.
   Increase → responsive changes kick in on wider screens.
   Decrease → responsive changes only apply on narrower screens. */
$max-width: 700px;

/* $med-width: used in _style.scss mobile breakpoints.
   Sets the max-width of .container and .body-container on tablets.
   Increase → content area wider on mid-size screens.
   Decrease → content area narrower on mid-size screens. */
$med-width: 600px;
